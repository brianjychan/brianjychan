### Whats up, I'm thinking about:

- Hardware
- Cultural Averages
- [Information intake](https://birdwatching.netlify.app)

Topics on backburner:

- Human Augmentation: can we use newly-introduced technology to improve preemptive cardiovascular medicine?


(What came out of last time: [Music](https://soundcloud.com/brianjychan/sets/extensions), Cities became Information intake)

### Most recently:

[AMFM: All My Friends' Music](https://amfm.me): get a private playlist, updated daily, containing any new songs that chosen friends add to their playlists.

[Birdwatching](https://birdwatching.netlify.app): intentionally design your Twitter using social graph categorization. Currently working on curation tools, and customizable logic.
